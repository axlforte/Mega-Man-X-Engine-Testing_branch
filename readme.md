# Mega Man X Engine  
Mega Man X Engine is a framework being developed using the GameMaker engine (formerly GameMaker Studio 2) that contains a lot of features Mega Man X games have so you don't have to do it yourself, plus new assets showing what is possible with the engine.  
Current version: v1.2.2.1? 

GameMaker Runtime version: v2024.4.1.201

Note: this engine is not complete yet, so not all features we want are in the engine. While you can definitely make a game with it, certain features may be clunky and or difficult to use as of current progress. 

### If you want more updates, you can just make your own. You have the tools, and we are willing to help.
